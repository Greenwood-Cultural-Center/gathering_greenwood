00:00:00.73 --> 00:00:04.06
Since the centennial
of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre,

2
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.12
there has been an increasing
amount of research about Greenwood.

3
00:00:08.03 --> 00:00:09.48
Over the past several years,

4
00:00:09.66 --> 00:00:13.26
documents, photographs,
and even video footage previously

5
00:00:13.28 --> 00:00:17.24
hidden from the public have been
digitized and published online.

6
00:00:19.07 --> 00:00:21.55
The challenge with this new
wealth of information is that all

7
00:00:21.56 --> 00:00:24.67
these resources are housed in many
different institutions,

8
00:00:24.69 --> 00:00:26.17
in different databases,

9
00:00:26.18 --> 00:00:28.15
both locally and nationally.

10
00:00:29.00 --> 00:00:33.00
We have more information than ever
before, and it needs to be organized.

11
00:00:34.24 --> 00:00:37.07
The team from Spark Collaborative
has been working with the Greenwood

12
00:00:37.08 --> 00:00:40.64
Cultural Center to compile
several public data sources,

13
00:00:41.30 --> 00:00:45.35
including census records,
maps, business directories,

14
00:00:45.64 --> 00:00:48.91
municipal land records,
and other sources of information

15
00:00:48.92 --> 00:00:51.52
into a single searchable resource.

16
00:00:52.97 --> 00:00:55.50
Today, we would like to show
you the progress we've made

17
00:00:55.53 --> 00:00:58.95
in creating this tool that will
soon be available to the public.

18
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Visualizing information on a map can
enhance our understanding of a story.

19
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Today, as we honor the Burleson
family, we're going to share

20
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
with you some information
about

21
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Atoya Burleson's ancestors who had

22
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
several businesses in Greenwood.

23
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
With this tool, you'll be able
to browse a map of Greenwood.

24
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Here you are seeing the map
of Greenwood in the year 1910.

25
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Since this interface is a touch
screen, you'll be able to zoom

26
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
in on the map similar to the way
you zoom in with a phone or tablet

27
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
to locate specific buildings.

28
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
The map will show,
based on historical records,

29
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
what was here during this time.

30
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Now we will switch to the year 1920.

31
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Touching a building will bring up its
details and show the information

32
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
that is available for this place.

33
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
The base layer data
for this map is the US census.

34
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
What we see in the census records is
that in 1930 there was a Lafayette L.

35
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Wilson living at 304 1/2
Greenwood Avenue, married to Ruby M.

36
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Wilson.

37
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Lafayette is listed
as a proprietor of a hotel.

38
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
We see something interesting
in the city phone

39
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
directory for this year.

40
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
If Lafayette was just living
at this Beach Hotel location,

41
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
it wouldn't have parentheses
and it would have "r.m.s."

42
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
in front of it,
indicating that he would

43
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
be rooming at this hotel.

44
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
So the parentheses indicate
for us that he was the owner

45
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
or the proprietor of the Beach Hotel.

46
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Lafayette L.

47
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Wilson is listed as living at the 
Beach Hotel at 304 1/2

48
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Greenwood Avenue.

49
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
We can see another property
associated with his name,

50
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Lafayette Hotel,
at 604 East Archer Street.

51
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
When we look at these documents,
we can see that his name

52
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
is on the deed.

53
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Wilson purchased this property
in February of 1931.

54
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
With these records, we can clearly
see that Lafayette L.

55
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Wilson had experience in the hotel
business and then purchased

56
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
this hotel, adding his name
to the story of Greenwood's

57
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
thriving once more a decade
following the massacre.

58
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
With the digitization of land
records, census records,

59
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
business directories,
newspaper articles, and other types

60
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
of documents, we have a wealth
of information at our fingertips.

61
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
The Greenwood Cultural Center is
proud to develop this interactive

62
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
genealogy exhibit titled
Gathering Greenwood.

63
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
The City of Tulsa has been
awarded the Emmett Till Cold

64
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Case Grant by the U.S.

65
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Department of Justice to investigate
the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre,

66
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
with a focus on forensic
genetic genealogy to identify

67
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
potential victims.

68
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
Part of this grant is the creation
of Gathering Greenwood,

69
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
an interactive kiosk that will
empower visitors to come and look

70
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
through these maps and records.

71
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
This is the first time in Tulsa's
history that this information will

72
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
be cross-referenced and displayed
on one visual digital exhibit.

73
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
We are honored to bring this resource
to the community and hope

74
00:00:04.53 --> 00:00:07.012
that you will return to discover
Greenwood in a new way.
