Welcome to Gathering Greenwood,
a digital map and timeline

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.018
of the Greenwood neighborhood
presented by the Greenwood Cultural Center.

3
00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:13.027
This is the first program of its kind
and will allow the user to locate buildings

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.013
and building types as well as the people
who lived in those buildings in Greenwood from 1910 and 1920.

5
00:00:21.016 --> 00:00:25.011
Thousands of census and public records
have been digitized in order

6
00:00:25.014 --> 00:00:29.019

or in rooming houses with multiple families.
